# Sentiment Analysis and NLP

This repository contains the code and results of a sentiment analysis project focused on understanding public perspectives on the Ukraine-Russia conflict using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Over 400,000 social media posts related to the conflict were scraped from Twitter and analyzed using various machine learning algorithms, including Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, achieving an average accuracy of 93%. Additionally, an ensemble model combining three of these algorithms achieved an accuracy of 95%. Pre-trained NLP models such as Google Natural Language API were also utilized to compare results, particularly focusing on data with negative sentiments. Advanced NLP techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) were employed to extract and visualize key thematic elements from the data. The project concludes with three strategic recommendations for the Ukrainian government and NGOs to enhance Ukraine's international image amidst the conflict with Russia. This repository serves as a resource for understanding public sentiment, analyzing key themes, and recommending strategic actions to improve public perception.
